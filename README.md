# Analyzing_financial_data_for_fraud_detection_using_the_Enron_email
The Enron scandal was one of the biggest corporate scandals in history that resulted in the company’s bankruptcy and several top executives being indicted for fraud. In this project, we will be using the Enron email dataset to identify fraudulent activities by analyzing financial data

Objectives: The main objective of this project is to detect fraudulent activities in the financial data using machine learning algorithms. Specifically, we will be working on the following tasks:
• Exploratory data analysis of the financial dataset
• Feature engineering to extract relevant features from the data
• Building a machine learning model to identify fraudulent activities
• Evaluating the performance of the model using appropriate metrics
